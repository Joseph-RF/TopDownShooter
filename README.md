# TopDownShooter


## Description

Gameplay revolves around a character (hero) you control which can be moved around using the WASD keys. 

Enemies will appear at the edges of the screen and move in a straight line towards you. If enemies reach you they will deal damage, lowering your health. Once your health reaches zero, game over.

Defend yourself from the waves of enemies by shooting at them by aiming with your cursor and clicking to fire.

The hero is the green square and the projectiles he fires at enemies are yellow. Every other square is an enemy.

There are different enemy colours corresponding to different classes.
